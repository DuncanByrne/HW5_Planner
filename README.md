# HW5_Planner

in this assignment we had to create a daily planner with what we learned this week in javascript, bootstrap amd jquery. 
The goal if this assignment was to make a daily planner to track what a person would do throughout the day. 
In this assignment we had to edit add the rows to display text in the html, with using jquery, javascript and moment.js
we had to establish the save button feature and display the current date above the planner and make sure it updates with each day.
To make the date constantly up date we used Moment().
